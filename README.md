# A* Algorithm - Visualised
***
## A visualised representation of the A* algorithm in JavaFX
### This app is aimed to help better understand the A* algorithm by visualising it on a matrix. The user can select the start and end points and the algorithm will find the shortest path between them. The app also has a reset button that will reset the matrix to a new state chosen by the user.

### 1. Technologies Used:
* JavaFX
* Maven
* Thread concurrency(multiple searches done at the same time)
* A* algorithm

### 2. The need:
* To get a better grasp of the A* algorithm and how it works

### 3. Features:
* User can select the size of the matrix(it doesn't have to be a square)
* User can select the start and end points
* User can reset the matrix to a new state
* User can see the algorithm in action
* User can see the algorithm's paths

### 4. How it works:
* The user first needs to select the size of the matrix. The matrix will be generated with random obstacles. The user can then select the start and end points. The algorithm will then find the shortest path between the two points. This action can be performed between multiple points on the matrix at once. The user can reset the matrix to a new state and see the algorithm in action again.
